              I am a computer science and psychology double major who loves to
              meet people, learn about their interests, and listen to their life
              stories. I am also an avid crocheter (you can check out some of my

              I am currently a student developer at the Duke University
              Innovation Co-Lab, where I hold office hours and work on exciting
              projects. This semester, I am working on a Tablet Interface that
              will help track Co-Lab workshop attendance and participant
              satisfaction!

              I just finished Duke University's Code+ Program where I built an
              AI Registrar tool that integrates the Duke University course
              catalog with Open AI's GPT-4's language capabilities to field
              questions about course registration and class recommendations.

              This semester, I will be taking Human Skills for Software
              Engineering (CS290), Psych Methods and Statistics (PSY205),
              Developmental Psychology (PSY103), and Introduction to Cultural
              Psychology (PSY105).

              I am also an undergraduate TA for Computer Architecture. I loved
              learning about the mechanisms behind technology, and Iâ€™m excited I
              get to teach it, too!
