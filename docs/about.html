        Hello World! I'm Esther, and I'm a current junior at Duke University in
        Durham, North Carolina. This is my virtual space where I showcase things
        I'm working on in and outside of class! I am a computer science and
        psychology double major who loves to meet people, learn about their
        interests, and listen to their life stories. I am also an avid crocheter
        (you can check out some of my projects
        <a href="myinterests.html">here</a>!)
      </p>

      <p class="headers">What I'm Doing Now</p>

      <p class="doingstuff">
        I am currently a student developer at the Duke University Innovation
        Co-Lab, where I hold office hours and work on exciting projects. This
        semester, I am working on a Tablet Interface that will help track Co-Lab
        workshop attendance and participant satisfaction!
      </p>
      <p class="doingstuff">
        I just finished Duke University's Code+ Program where I built an AI
        Registrar tool that integrates the Duke University course catalog with
        Open AI's GPT-4's language capabilities to field questions about course
        registration and class recommendations.
      </p>

      <p class="doingstuff">
        This semester, I will be taking Human Skills for Software Engineering
        (CS290), Psych Methods and Statistics (PSY205), Developmental Psychology
        (PSY103), and Introduction to Cultural Psychology (PSY105).
